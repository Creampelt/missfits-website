      <p>
        Missfits Mission Home was launched in the summer of 2018,
        when one of our members flew to Japan to present to middle and high school students about FIRST. There, the
        founder of MeetsVision, an institution that advocates the spread of hands-on STEM-based learning, saw our demo and
        invited us to present the same week in front of top high school students and tech companies around Japan during
        one of their workshops. Japan currently only has 3 FRC teams, and we aim to increase this number while continuing
        to branch out to the rest of the world. We plan to continue our efforts of spreading the FIRST message around the
        globe.

        San Francisco’s first all-girls robotics team, led by a Lowell senior, met teams from as far as China and Mexico

        Move over fellas, some young women in San Francisco are making waves in a field dominated by men — robotics.
        They haven't been at it long, but they're already being noticed.

        For the last several weeks, a team of engineers, coders and builders has been assembling Robot 6418. They are
        the Missfits, an all-girl team from five high schools across San Francisco. They had a strong performance at a
